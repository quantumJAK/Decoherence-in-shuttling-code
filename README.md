This repository provice the source code which can be used to reconstruct the results of the pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12185

### Implemented features:
- [x] Averaged Adiabatic Master Equation (AME) code
- [x] Relaxation for GaAs and SiGe devices code
- [x] Figure 5 - AME for GaAs and SiGe (main result)
- [ ] Figure 8 - Spin relaxation
- [ ] Figure 4 - Dephasing during relaxation
- [ ] Figure 3 - Spin Relaxation
- [ ] Figure 9 - Dephasing during adiabatic evolution

### Developement:
- [ ] Separate relaxation functions from utils
- [ ] Implement the remaining figures
- [ ] Add user defined parameters of device
